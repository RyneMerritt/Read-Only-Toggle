# Read-Only-Toggle
A toggle that enables/disables read only mode on user-selected files.
The inspiration for this program is read only quest reward farming for borderlands 2, but I plan on allowing the user to select 
either a specific file, or the latest modified file, and allow several, yet-to-be implimented toggle options.
